# Social Network API

## Purpose
This API is designed for a social media startup. Upon entering the command to run this application, 'npm start', the server of the code is started and the Moongoose models are synced to a MongoDB database. This application has four categories of data - User, Friend, Thought, and Reaction. An API-testing software can be used to test the routes of this social network application. For 'User' and 'Thought', data can be displayed, created, updated, and deleted. For 'Friend' and 'Reaction', data can be created and deleted. This application provides a backend to enable the handling of large amounts of unstructured data.
